# Audience-Affection-Predictor
LSTM based model to accurately predict audience affective responses from smartphone sensory data collected from an indivisual audience member at the end of a performance.
The model was developed by me and some colleagues for an assignment on a course on machine learning that focused on sensory data. The dataset was created by us using our smartphones with the help of an application called PhyPhox (more detailed description in the report). Thus, due to security constraints, I have not provided the dataset in the files, however, the report goes into detail on how to recreate the dataset using a custom phyphox experiment.
